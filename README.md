# Learn-Chinese-FPGA-Game
This was my final project for Advanced Digital Design using the Verilog language

Our team’s proposal focused on game memorization. The concept of the game begins by showing four
different patterns that we’ve created and associating them somehow with a switch or button. Once the
player understands what pattern correlates with which button, then they can press a button to start the
game. Every round a different pattern will be displayed on the 7-segment decoder and the player must
then append that pattern to the list of patterns they’ve already seen. After thinking about a game that
could use this idea, we incorporated a program dedicated to learning Chinese number characters. This
program will display four random Chinese characters where the player will have to press key button that
matches a certain character. These Chinese numbers are 1, 2, 3, and 7 which are shown in Figure 1. The
player is expected to memorize a button combination. The key combo will be matched to four different
Chinese numbers.
